# Tutor Effectiveness Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different tutors by analyzing student outcomes, engagement metrics, and feedback scores. The project involves using statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to understand how each tutor performs based on various factors. This analysis is done using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Streamlit for creating interactive dashboards.

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to:
- Evaluate how student outcomes, engagement, and feedback vary across different tutors.
- Use statistical methods (such as ANOVA) to test whether the differences between tutors' effectiveness are significant.
- Visualize key metrics to provide a comprehensive view of tutor performance.

## Skills Used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit
- **Statistical Analysis**: ANOVA, T-tests
- **Data Visualization**: Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **File Handling**: CSV file processing

## Project Workflow

The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: The data includes student IDs, tutor IDs, session information, engagement scores, outcome scores, and feedback scores.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring it's ready for analysis.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform ANOVA tests to analyze differences in engagement, outcome, and feedback scores across different tutors.
4. **Data Visualization**: Generate visualizations to better understand tutor performance.
5. **Interactive Dashboard**: Build a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard to interact with the data and visualizations.
